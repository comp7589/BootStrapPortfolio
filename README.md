# BootStrap Portfolio

Homework#2 - My Portfolio Built with Bootstrap

## Installation

There are no installation instructions for this project because there are only three .html files, and one .css file required to run these pages. Bootstrap and CSS have been linked inside the <head>.

## Usage

This assignment reqires 3 .html pages that have NAV BAR access to all three through anchor links. The About Me page (.index.html) has a brief description of myself, paired with a profile image. The Portfolio Gallery (portfolio.html) page includes a bootstrap based grid of images. These images are links to future project builds. Lastly, the Contact (contact.html) page includes a form with three user defined inputs. Name, E-mail address, and a message (if applicable). There is a sumbit button for the user to send contact form message. There is additional stylings throught the .html pages on style.css.
