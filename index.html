            <p class="lead">I am from Lawton, Oklahoma. I attended the University of Oklahoma for my undergraduate
                degree. I obtained a Bachelor of Science in 2010 specalizing in Multidisciplinary Studies: Technical Sciences.
                 In that time, I began to study base elements of Solidworks and Java. This is where my love of technology 
                 and software began to grow. After I graduated from the University of Oklahoma, I moved to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 
                 to begin my career. I started in the oil & gas industry as an independent landman. This was very enjoyable,
                and I found the work very satisfying, as well.
                <br>
                I moved to Denver, Colorado in March of 2013. I made the move for a number of reasons. Most important
                being that I had landed a new job working for Garlock Pipeline Technologies in Wheatridge, Colorado. 
                In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, distance running, skiing, riding my
                bike, experiencing live music, camping, reading, yoga, and traveling.
