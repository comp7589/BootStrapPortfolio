            <p class="lead px-2">I am originally born & raised in Lawton, Oklahoma. I attended the University of
                Oklahoma, in
                Norman, OK,
                for my undergraduate degree. I obtained a Bachelor of Science in 2010 specalizing in Multidisciplinary
                Studies: Technical Sciences.
                In that time, I began to study base elements of Solidworks and Java. This is where my love of technology
                and software began to grow. After I graduated from the University of Oklahoma, I moved to Oklahoma City,
                Oklahoma
                to begin my career. I started in the oil & gas industry as an independent landman. This was very
                enjoyable,
                and I found the work very satisfying, as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                I moved to Denver, Colorado in March of 2013, and instantly fell in love with everything this state has
                to offer.
                The most important reason for getting to be here was that I had landed a new job working for Garlock
                Pipeline Technologies
                in Wheatridge, Colorado. In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, distance
                running, skiing, riding my
                bike, experiencing live music, camping, reading, yoga, and traveling.
